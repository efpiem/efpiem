# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a computer engineer who loves turning ideas into real-world projects. From a Telegram bot that detects and counts Euro coins to a YouTube downloader with automated metadata tagging, I enjoy building solutions that make life easier. Iâ€™m passionate about software engineering, robotics, and machine learning â€” always curious to learn and experiment with new technologies.
