# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a computer engineer who loves turning ideas into real-world projects. From Python bots that count coins to automated grape measurement systems, I enjoy building solutions that make life easier. Iâ€™m passionate about robotics, web development, and collaborating with international teamsâ€”always curious to learn and experiment with new technologies.
