# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a computer engineer who loves designing and building practical, technology-driven solutions. From a Telegram bot that detects and counts Euro coins to a YouTube playlist downloader with automated metadata tagging, I enjoy creating tools that simplify everyday tasks. Iâ€™m passionate about software engineering, robotics, and machine learning â€” always eager to learn, explore, and experiment with new technologies.
